This is a hot-fix-release based on 8.0.0-alpha14 as an unintended release was put couple of weeks ago.
It fixes the unintended release's issues and function reliably but still comparably laggy as Compose still doesn't provide the best performance and a true release would take much. Till then, here's some highlights:
* Update: New update format (The app still support older ones)
* Fix: All A12 issues on v7
* Add: Backup/restore given permissions
* Update: Less manual refresh is needed
* Fixed: Most of the special backups (still need testing)
* Tags & Notes are disabled for now
