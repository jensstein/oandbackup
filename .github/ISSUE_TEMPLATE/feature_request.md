**Additional Notes**

* If you're on the latest Test version (from the Telegram Channel or the Matrix Room) please report there directly, not here.

* If you're on the latest GitHub version:
  
  * Please read the [FAQ](https://github.com/NeoApplications/Neo-Backup/blob/master/FAQ.md) first.
  
  * Please read all the open Issues. If you find one that matches yours, leave a comment there if there's some extra information you can provide.

* If you're not on the latest GitHub version, update the app. Then make sure that the feature is still not there. If it's not, go ahead and check the closed issues (maybe it was already requested and got refused), otherwise go ahead with your request.

Thanks for your suggestion
