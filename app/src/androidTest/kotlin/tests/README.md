Test_* are unittests.

They are designed to check if things work.

Unfortunately there is no way to say something like:
"this test fails now and this is ok, we just want to see in the future, when it starts to work"

There is no machinery in place to automatically check unittests before release or something like that.

In fact, tests are currently used very loosely, mostly when some parts are under heavy de/construction.
