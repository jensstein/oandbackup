        <p><strong>Yedekleme modları</strong>: Bir uygulama yalnızca apk'si, yalnızca verileri veya her ikisi ile yedeklenebilir. Kurulu durumda olmayan bir uygulama yalnızca apk dosyası varsa geri yüklenebilir. Üç özel veri tipi ana data için desteklenir: aygıt korumalı veri, dış veri ve obb veri
        </p>
        <p><strong>Delete backup</strong>: Deletes the backup files for a specific backup instance. While "delete backups" delete all of the backups of the chosen app.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Uninstall</strong>: Somewhat more aggressive than a normal uninstall. In addition to doing a normal uninstall via Android commands, uninstalling from OAndBackupX deletes files the app might have left over in /data/app-lib/.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Enable / disable</strong>: Uses the Android `pm` script to enable or disable an app. Disabling an app removes it from the normal user interface without uninstalling it. This can be used for enabling or disabling an app for multiple users at a time (if the device has multiple users). Users are identified with an ID e.g. 0 is the first user (owner) 10 is usually the work profile.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Multiple users</strong>: Multi-user is still somewhat experimental but should work. Enabling and disabling only works after an initial install (not necessarily from OAndBackupx) or restore of the app.
        </p>
        <p><strong>System-less apps</strong>: Backup and restore of system-less apps installed as Magisk modules is not supported and trying it could lead to system failure and forcing you to format and flash it anew.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Navigation</strong>: The navigation bar has "Settings", "Home", "Batch backup", "Batch restore" and "Schedule backups" (in that order). The number of apps upgraded after their last backup will be presented as a notification on "Home" button.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Apps using Keystore</strong>: Android has an encrypted storage for sensitive data. Apps that make use of this to store login data or some keys for its function can't be restored successfully. Two examples of such apps are Signal and Element(Riot).
